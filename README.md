# The why

Updating my personal page always felt like a hassle, so I tried to make it easier.

This project turns `Markdown` files into a personal site with minimal effort. No manual HTML updates or overcomplicated CMS - just local `markdown` (straight from my Obsidian vault, but any source works), a script to fetch and process it, and the site builds itself using `Vue` and `unplugin-vue-markdown`. Clean, simple, and (I hope!) maintainable.
